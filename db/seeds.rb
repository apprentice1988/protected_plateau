		:description=>"For thousands of years pyramids have been built by civilizations all over the world as sacred places, sometimes hiding burial chambers filled with cherished objects and treasure. These delicate glass pyramids can be the home for your most precious possessions, in safe display for all to see. 

	This listing is for the smaller pyramid, with a 3 inch square base. Perfect for rings, delicate necklaces, and natural wonders. 

	The pyramid is hinged, so it can be displayed open or closed. You have the choice of two hinged styles: either one triangle hinged or the entire pyramid hinged; and two finishes: silver or copper.

	I construct these from clear glass and a lead-free, silver alloy solder.

	When ordering please specify color of metal (silver or copper) and which hinge you would like (single triangle hinged or whole pyramid hinged).",
